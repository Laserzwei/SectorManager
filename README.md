# Sector Manager
A small mod to keep a set of sectors loaded, while a player is online.

### Install instructions

Place the contents of the "mods" folder into your /steam/.../Avorion/mods/ folder.

This script will allow for comfortable selection of the sectors desired to be loaded.

The list of sectors is stored for each player separately.

The config should be self-explanatory.
